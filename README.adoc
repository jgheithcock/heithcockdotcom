# Readme

Readme for heithcock.com site using https://nextjs.org/[Vercel's Next.js]. (Formerly Ruby on Rails on Heroku - c.f. heithcockdotcom repo).

This needs to be at least a partially dynamic site as the /home pages require a /api/proxy.js for fetching rss
to get around the Cross-site scripting limitation (that is, javascript in a local page is prevented by the browser
from fetching rss from a different site.)

This then is two sites under the heithcock.com umbrella. My personal website and Suzy's /home/suzy version of iGoogle.

## Development, testing and deploying

To see the work in a local browser, choose a new terminal and type `npm run dev`.

To deploy, push using GitHub.


## JG's site

The site is simlar to Suzy's elsworthartworks.com site, with a home page that lists out the categories of things I
want to show and under them, a gallery of connected items.

One possible difference is that I might have a hero post section with whatever the latest post was.

I might also add an extract of a line or three underneath the image with an icon to read more.

One more thought, for each category, having a description at the top. Only show two lines with a "[More]" link
