## Next.js (Vercel) Original Readme

This is a https://nextjs.org/[Next.js] project bootstrapped with https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app[`create-next-app`].

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction[API routes] can be accessed on http://localhost:3000/api/hello. This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction[API routes] instead of React pages.
