# Readme

Readme for heithcock.com site using Vercel's Next.js. (Formerly Ruby on Rails on Heroku - c.f. heithcockdotcom repo).

This needs to be at least a partially dynamic site as the /home pages require a /api/proxy.js for fetching rss
to get around the Cross-site scripting limitation (that is, javascript in a local page is prevented by the browser
from fetching rss from a different site.)

This then is two sites under the heithcock.com umbrella. My personal website and Suzy's /home/suzy version of iGoogle.

## JG's site

The site is simlar to Suzy's elsworthartworks.com site, with a home page that lists out the categories of things I
want to show and under them, a gallery of connected items.

One possible difference is that I might have a hero post section with whatever the latest post was.

I might also add an extract of a line or three underneath the image with an icon to read more.

One more thought, for each category, having a description at the top. Only show two lines with a "[More]" link

## Next.js (Vercel) Original Readme

This is a https://nextjs.org/[Next.js] project bootstrapped with https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app[`create-next-app`].

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction[API routes] can be accessed on http://localhost:3000/api/hello. This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction[API routes] instead of React pages.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- https://nextjs.org/docs[Next.js Documentation] - learn about Next.js features and API.
- https://nextjs.org/learn[Learn Next.js] - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out https://github.com/vercel/next.js/[the Next.js GitHub repository] - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme[Vercel Platform] from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment[Next.js deployment documentation] for more details.
