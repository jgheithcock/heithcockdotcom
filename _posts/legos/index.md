![The Lego Gringotts Bank, assembled in its full glory](/images/legos/gringotts/gringotts-assembled.png)

<div class="preface">

_For Christmas, my daughter and I received the [Lego Gringotts Bank](https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/gringotts-wizarding-bank--collectors-edition-76417). This is a massive, 31 bag, 4801 piece set, and we were only able to finish the first half (the underground section) before she needed to go back to Boston. I glibly told her I would take pictures as I went and send them to her so she could experience it&mdash;second hand at least._

_I then idealistically thought how cool it would be to string the photos together to make a kind of stop-motion animation. And so my journey down the rabbit hole began. There is a Lego guard in bag 16, and I thought it would be funny to have him panicking and running around while the bank was being magically built around him._

_You then find a goblin in bag 18 and so it made sense to have the goblin be the one magically creating the bank. Then I started thinking "Hunh, what happens now...?"_
