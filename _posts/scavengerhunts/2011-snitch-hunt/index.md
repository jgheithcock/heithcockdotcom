The one that started it all.

While we were in the temporary house on Hutchinson Court, I made a scavenger hunt for my daughter for her birthday. As it went so well, I decided to do one for our first Christmas in the newly rebuilt house on Westwind. We were both very enamoured with the Marauder's map (and the Prisoner of Azkeban in general) and I was fortunate to find a [template from Britta Peterson](http://www.brittablvd.com/wizards/Year6/prep/map/mapnp.html) that she very kindly shared on [her site](http://www.britta.com/).

I created seven maps, one for each of the books. Each map had the middle section replaced with the area of the house where the next clue could be found, with footsteps leading more or less to the spot. Each of these were done in the Marauder's Map style with words for lines.

</a>

_Note the footsteps in the top left. That was a clue to where the goblet was with the next map inside._

I made little banners to 'pop up' in the middle of the map with clues that were appropriate for each book:

- _Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone_ <br/> Where you would go to play Wizard's Chess (By a chess set in my office)
- _Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets_ <br/> Next, defeat a boggart (In a cabinet in Guest bedroom)
- _Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban_ <br/> Beware of the Shrieking Shack (In her tree house)
- _Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire_ <br/> Dring from a Goblet of Dragon's Fire (Dining room/great room)
- _Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix_ <br/> Find a Phoenix... (By a stuffed animal version of Fawkes in my office)
- _Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince_ <br/> In the Room of Requirement... (In her upstairs secret closet)
- _Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows_ <br/> Where these and all the others live... (Inside the box of HP books in the Guest hall)

At the end of it, she found the snitch - a round ball that opened to reveal a USB flash drive with the Stephen Fry version of the Harry Potter audiobooks. The ball was the same one I had used by the way (oh so many years ago) to hold the engagement ring when I proposed to my wife - it survived the fire!

The first map, the snitch and the USB flash drive - I think the ball didn't quite close as the key was just a bit too big!

The snitch, closed and ready to be found.

The snitch and the audiobook on a USB flash drive - this smaller form factor was relatively new-fangled in 2011.
