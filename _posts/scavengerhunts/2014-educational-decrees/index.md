For the fourth scavenger hunt, I happened across [KylieSmiley16's Educational Decree template](https://www.deviantart.com/kyliesmiley16/art/HP-Educational-Decree-Template-302224893) and saw that it was ready-made for my purposes. As before, we went with seven clues, though not connected with the books this time.

We had a tacit understanding for the prior scavenger hunts that, unless explicity called out, the clues would be indoors, on "our side" of the house and also on the main floor or downstairs and this was no exception.

The big concept here was that, as a _true Gryffindor_, she would need to break each and every one of the decrees. Later of course she informed me she was a _true Ravenclaw_ but the defiance remained.
