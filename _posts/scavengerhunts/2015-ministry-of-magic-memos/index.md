Once again, I was saved by the Internet. Robin Springett had created a template for [Ministry of Magic memos](https://10digitdesign.blogspot.com/2014/07/how-to-make-ministry-of-magic-memo.html) that, as [KylieSmiley had done](./2014-educational-decrees), was ready made to be turned into a Scavenger hunt. (Well, I did need to convert it from A4 to US 8.5 x 11" paper)

The other inspiration was the _wonderful_ letters Harry received in _The Order of the Phoenix_ from Mafalda Hopkirk, with such cheerful signoffs after horrible news. In this case, each memo would restrict the possible locations of both _parcels and memorandums_ to differen areas of the house.
