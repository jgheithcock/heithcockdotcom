For a change, I eschewed Photoshop and just wrote the opening clue - a letter from Newt explaining that he had left his trunk behind - in a spiral and decorated it with some alchemical symbols and a dragon head in the center for the Chinese Fireball.

## The Letter

</a>

So you don't tweak your neck, the letter in plain form is...

> Dear Morgan,
>
> I'm afraid that in  
> my hurried departure  
> I left my trunk behind –
>
> just as well perhaps as  
> going through customs  
> again might be more  
> challenging this time.
>
> I'd like for you to keep it and  
> safeguard it and its contents.
>
> Please feel free to make use of it  
> and anything you find there.
>
> There should be some useful kit for  
> a budding naturalist such as yourself.  
> The only issue is that I'm dashed
>
> if I can remember where I left it.  
> I'm sure it isn't on the top floor,  
> or outside.
>
> I have a feeling that it was by  
> one of the animals you showed me  
> – perhaps that lovely Chinese Fireball?
>
> Best of luck,  
> Newt Scamander

The letter was then folded in a variant of the "Twist Note" from [Michael G. LaFosse and Richard L. Alexander's Origami Stationery](http://origamido.rochlis.com/products/origami_stationery.php). My variant is more suited to the scavenger hunt as it folds into a minature Marauders Map. Interestingly, I think this was my own innovation. Later, in 2017, Thomas Hull and Michael Urbanski did a very nice paper on [the Augmented Square Twist](http://origametry.net/ast/ast.html) which shows this in detail.

Here is the box with the folded letter and the origami animals you will find.

To start this hunt, you first find a lovely red dragon stuffed animal, and inside its mouth is an origami...

Unfolding the dragon revealed another hand-drawn note:

> _Oh, hmm, hope you weren't too singed. Perhaps it was the three unicorns?_

The three unicorns was a painting of three horses - which is how muggles see unicorns. Behind that painting were...

She had gotten a stuffed pygmy puff and so this was an easy find, under it was a...

> _Well, this is what comes of having such a wonderful menagerie. How about that bowtruckle—the one with the curious affinity for grapevines?_

And in a sconce of a figure with grapevines was a...

The part of the bowtrucle was played by a [Praying Mantis](http://en.origami-club.com/bug/mantis/mantis/index.html).

> _Hmm, no, no, clearly not. I'm sure we are close. Didn't you show me a wonderful Gryffindor Lion?_

Once again, [Suzy's Italian Lion](https://www.elsworthartworks.com/oil/past/italian_lion_waterspout.html) was pressed into service, behind it was a...

> _Sigh, I so apologize for the inconvenience. Maybe it wasn't an actual animal—weren't you asking me about that empty grindylow tank?_

As in the [third scavenger hunt](./2013-44-marauders), the aquarium is the Gryndylow tank. Between it and the wall was a...

For the Grindylow, I used an (Octopus)[https://www.sushiyasuda.com/merchandise/tako.html]

Where do salamander's live? The pizza oven! And in the (cold) pizza oven was her present (in a trunk) with a...
