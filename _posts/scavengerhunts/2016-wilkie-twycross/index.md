For my daughter's sixteenth birthday, I made a little scavenger hunt based on [Wilkie Twycross](https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Wilkie_Twycross), who taught apparition to sixth years at Hogwarts in [Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Half-Blood_Prince).

> _“Oh, she was perfect, obviously,’ said Ron, before Hermione could answer. ‘Perfect deliberation, divination and desperation, or whatever the hell it is – we all went for a quick drink in the Three Broomsticks after and you should’ve heard Twycross going on about her – I’ll be surprised if he doesn’t pop the question soon –”_

The concept was to recreate Wilkie's flyer and have her 'apparate' from one clue to the next:

<a href="/images/scavengerhunts/2016-wilkie-twycross/flyer.jpg">
<img src="/images/scavengerhunts/2016-wilkie-twycross/flyer.jpg" alt="Wilkie Twycross's flyer for teaching the three D's of Apparition" class="mapBorder" />
</a>

<hr/>
In the box with the flyer were two notes. One from Albus Dumbledore (so setting the rules that this scavenger hunt would take place out of doors):

<a href="/images/scavengerhunts/2016-wilkie-twycross/note-from-albus.jpg">
<img src="/images/scavengerhunts/2016-wilkie-twycross/note-from-albus.jpg" alt="Note from Albus" class="mapBorder" />
</a>

The second was the first instruction from Wilkie:

<a href="/images/scavengerhunts/2016-wilkie-twycross/destination.jpg">
<img src="/images/scavengerhunts/2016-wilkie-twycross/destination.jpg" alt="Wilkie's instruction for destination" class="mapBorder" />
</a>

Under the sundial by the waterfall was Wilkie's second instruction:

<a href="/images/scavengerhunts/2016-wilkie-twycross/determination.jpg">
<img src="/images/scavengerhunts/2016-wilkie-twycross/determination.jpg" alt="Wilkie's instruction for determination" class="mapBorder" />
</a>

This was a bit of a stretch, but when you realize how many spiders had taken over the tree house, you would find the last instruction:

<a href="/images/scavengerhunts/2016-wilkie-twycross/deliberation.jpg">
<img src="/images/scavengerhunts/2016-wilkie-twycross/deliberation.jpg" alt="Wilkie's instruction for deliberation" class="mapBorder" />
</a>

The Roc is a large bird, and so if you looked in the chicken coop, you would find your present - a new key fob to my Prius (No, I didn't buy her a car for her sixteenth birthday!)
