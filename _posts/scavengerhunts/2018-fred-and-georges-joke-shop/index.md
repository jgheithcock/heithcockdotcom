There used to be a Boswell's near us with a lot of joke items such as whoopee cushions, stink bombs, gelling liquid, etc. And so I thought about having a "Fred & George" scavenger hunt where they would get you to clean up their junk (the joke items) as part of the clues. I love origami and there are several scenes in the Harry Potter films where the characters send or receive letters that are folded in some origami pattern and I thought I would incorporate that as well. Many of the following origami cards came from [Origami Card Craft](https://www.amazon.com/Origami-Card-Craft-Clever-Envelopes/dp/030740840X), by Karen Elaine Thomas.

_All the clues together..._

## The Clues

In the present box was a...

### Howler

The [howler](https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Howler) was derived from the Kiss from [Origami Card Craft](<(https://www.amazon.com/Origami-Card-Craft-Clever-Envelopes/dp/030740840X)>) (altered to use a single sheet of paper).

_The howler, still closed._

_The howler, opened. This Howler is more like the one Harry receives in the [Order of the Phoenix](https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Howler?file=Ministry_letter_speaking_OOTP.png)_

_Unfolded..._

</a>

To save you reading my handwriting (which was surely part of the challenge), the text of the opening clue is...

> **&ldquo;FRED & GEORGE...&rdquo;**
>
> _...Whoops, sorry about that_  
> _We repurposed one of Mom's old howlers to tell you_  
> — _that *we're* organizing your Christmas scavenger hunt this year._  
> _Yes, we got told off to clean out our junk_  
> — _fabulous prototypes you mean..._  
> _Right, George, "fabulous prototypes"_  
> — _for the Muggle market._  
> _and we thought_  
> — _why not let someone else do it!_  
> _Exactly, but we arranged for a nice treat at the end!_  
> — _So, just follow the clues_  
> _To find the next — what did you call them?_  
> — _fabulous prototype_  
> _that will lead you to the next!_  
> — _Your first clue is:_  
> &nbsp;  
> _Where would you go to find a place to sit!_

After searching several chairs, you find one with a cushion and behind the cushion were...

### Fart-in-a-can and Secret Plans

_Exactly as it says on the tin [^1]..._
[^1]: Contains gaseous fart sounds, no smells added.

</a>

_and top secret plans[^2]_

[^2]: This was a twist on [Yami Yamauchi's Magic Wallet](http://www.spitenet.com/origami/pdf/MagicWallet.pdf)

<img src="/images/scavengerhunts/2018-fred-and-georges-joke-shop/top-secret-plans.jpg" alt="Origami Secret Plans" class="mapBorder" />
</a>

The twist is that if you open the _Secret Plans_ the normal way, you only see insults[^3]...
[^3]: Well known insults from _[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Prisoner_of_Azkaban)_

<a href="/images/scavengerhunts/2018-fred-and-georges-joke-shop/top-secret-insults.jpg">

</a>

> _Mr Moony presents his compliments to Professor Snape, and begs him to keep his abnormally large nose out of other people’s business._  
> _Mr Prongs agrees with Mr Moony, and would like to add that Professor Snape is an ugly git._  
> _Mr Padfoot would like to register his astonishment that an idiot like that ever became a Professor._  
> _Mr Wormtail bids Professor Snape good day, and advises him to wash his hair, the slimeball._

But if you turn it over and open it, you see the real clue...

</a>

> _Well done!_  
> — _Knew you could do it!_  
> _We thought we had a real winner &ldquo;hear&rdquo;_  
> — _sometimes you want the smell, sometimes you just want the sound_  
> _but for some reason, it was &ldquo;silent&rdquo; in the market._  
> — _in any case, your next clue is:_  
> _speaking of smell..._
>
> _Where would you go for a bad smell?_

I'm always intrigued how my daughter will go right to the spot for clues that I think are real stumpers and then be lost for what I thought was easy - of course, I clean the kitty litter...

### Stink bombs and a Pin-wheel

<a href="/images/scavengerhunts/2018-fred-and-georges-joke-shop/stink-bombs.png">
<img src="/images/scavengerhunts/2018-fred-and-georges-joke-shop/stink-bombs.png" alt="Stink bombs" class="mapBorder" />
</a>

The clue was a varient of the pin-wheel card from _Origami Card Craft_, with the corners folded down to accentuate the pin-wheel.

<a href="/images/scavengerhunts/2018-fred-and-georges-joke-shop/pinwheel.jpg">
<img src="/images/scavengerhunts/2018-fred-and-georges-joke-shop/pinwheel.jpg" alt="Origami pin-wheel card" class="mapBorder" />
</a>

_Unfolded..._

<a href="/images/scavengerhunts/2018-fred-and-georges-joke-shop/pinwheel-clue.jpg">
<img src="/images/scavengerhunts/2018-fred-and-georges-joke-shop/pinwheel-clue.jpg" alt="Clue from pin-wheel card" class="mapBorder" />
</a>

In plain text...

> _So, when the noise only version didn't work,_  
> — _we tried a smell-only one_  
> _which also didn't work._  
> — _But you now reap the result_  
> _and the smell._  
> — _In any case, the next clue is:_
>
> _Where would you go to be in the dark?_

Clearly, a lot of dark places in one's house but, for her, it was too easy as we had gotten to calling her secret closet _the Room of Requirement_. In the closet was a ...

### Mystic Smoke and a Fortune Teller

_Mystic Smoke - an alternative to Peruvian Instant-Darkness powder_

<img src="/images/scavengerhunts/2018-fred-and-georges-joke-shop/mystic-smoke.png" alt="Mystic Smoke" class="mapBorder" />
</a>

_A standard [Fortune teller fold](https://www.wikihow.com/Fold-a-Fortune-Teller), what made it distinctive was the paper, a gift from my mom. It has some very decorative borders that show off well in many of the folds._

<a href="/images/scavengerhunts/2018-fred-and-georges-joke-shop/fortune-teller.jpg">
<img src="/images/scavengerhunts/2018-fred-and-georges-joke-shop/fortune-teller.jpg" alt="Origami fortune teller card" class="mapBorder" />
</a>

_And your fortune..._

<a href="/images/scavengerhunts/2018-fred-and-georges-joke-shop/fortune-teller-clue.jpg">
<img src="/images/scavengerhunts/2018-fred-and-georges-joke-shop/fortune-teller-clue.jpg" alt="Origami fortune teller clue" class="mapBorder" />
</a>

> _Another sure-fire_  
> _— flop._  
> _The thought was either an alternative to Peruvian Instant-Darkness powder_  
> _— and when that didn't work_  
> _an instant thundercloud potion!_  
> _— that also didn't work._  
> _Moving on, the next clue is:_
>
> _Where would you go for an electrifying time?_

Another stumper, but she finally thought of the panel for the circuit breakers in the larder and found a...

### Blah-Blah Pen and a Round-Square Card

_The blah-blah pen, supposedly it had a twelve ways of saying "blah blah blah blah"..._

<a href="/images/scavengerhunts/2018-fred-and-georges-joke-shop/blah-blah-pen.png">
<img src="/images/scavengerhunts/2018-fred-and-georges-joke-shop/blah-blah-pen.png" alt="The Blah-blah pen" class="mapBorder" />
</a>

The clue was a flat fortune teller, but what made it stand out was the rounded corners and pattern on the paper.

<a href="/images/scavengerhunts/2018-fred-and-georges-joke-shop/round-square.jpg">
<img src="/images/scavengerhunts/2018-fred-and-georges-joke-shop/round-square.jpg" alt="Origami pin-wheel card" class="mapBorder" />
</a>

_Unfolded to reveal the clue..._

</a>

> _So this one..._  
> _— yes, this one..._  
> _Well, we were thinking a muggle version of the Muffliato spell..._  
> _— Let's just move on to —_
>
> _Where would you go to find a *dry* spot?_

We had just started a little succulent section in my office and nestled among these were...

### Gelling liquid and a Napkin fold clue

<a href="/images/scavengerhunts/2018-fred-and-georges-joke-shop/gelling-liquid.jpg">
<img src="/images/scavengerhunts/2018-fred-and-georges-joke-shop/gelling-liquid.jpg" alt="Gelling Liquid" class="mapBorder" />
</a>

_The clue is a well-known [napkin fold](https://www.instructables.com/Thanksgiving-DIY-Crafts-Napkin-Fold-Card/). As above, the border of the paper really makes this one stand out._

<a href="/images/scavengerhunts/2018-fred-and-georges-joke-shop/napkin.jpg">
<img src="/images/scavengerhunts/2018-fred-and-georges-joke-shop/napkin.jpg" alt="Origami Napkin Fold" class="mapBorder" />

</a>

> _Getting warmer here!_  
> _— Yes, this one actually works!_  
> _But don't slip it in your Dad's coffee_  
> _— Like we did..._  
> _Again, moving on to the **last** clue_
>
> _Where would you go to find distracted muggles?_

I thought this was going to be an easy one, but eventually she looked behind the TV and found...

### Decoy Detonator and a Crane

_We had gotten this Decoy Detonator replica when we went to Harry Potter world and here was a great use as the final joke item._

<a href="/images/scavengerhunts/2018-fred-and-georges-joke-shop/decoy-detonator.jpg">
<img src="/images/scavengerhunts/2018-fred-and-georges-joke-shop/decoy-detonator.jpg" alt="Decoy Detonator" class="mapBorder" />
</a>

_The clue is a version of the crane, again from *Origami Card Craft*._

<a href="/images/scavengerhunts/2018-fred-and-georges-joke-shop/crane.jpg">
<img src="/images/scavengerhunts/2018-fred-and-georges-joke-shop/crane.jpg" alt="Origami Crane Card" class="mapBorder" />

_Unfolded..._

> _You found it!_  
> _— And so, here is one that actually seemed pretty successful_  
> _— until the cease and desist letters started_  
> _— And so, for your treat:_  
> _Where would you go to find a baby dragon?_

And the answer, that she got right away, is the Pizza Oven - it is a nice big spot that fits in well for these.
