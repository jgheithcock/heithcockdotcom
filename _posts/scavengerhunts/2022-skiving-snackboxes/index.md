I had enjoyed making [Fred & George's joke shop](./2018-fred-and-georges-joke-shop) back in 2018. I especially like the sing-song manner of the two brothers completing each others sentences for delivering the clues. Additionally, we had received the [Lego Diagon Alley](https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/diagon-alley-75978) in a prior Christmas, which has a great version of their shop, [Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes](https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Weasleys%27_Wizard_Wheezes). All of this gave me the idea of doing a scavenger hunt using their [Skiving Snackboxes](https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Skiving_Snackbox) to hold the clues.

There were [many](https://acciomagic.wordpress.com/2013/10/07/skiving-snackbox-here-at-last/) [online](https://wizardryworkshop.com/the-skiving-snackbox-harry-potter-diy/) [diy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9lp-7ihgRI) [versions](https://beautybyageek.blogspot.com/2015/05/harry-potter-skiving-snackbox-diy.html) — that, to be fair, are quite faithful to the original [MinaLima advertisement](https://minalima.com/product/skiving-snackbox-advertisement/). But we both loved the orange and purple boxes from the [Wii Lego Harry Potter: Years 5-7](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego_Harry_Potter:_Years_5%E2%80%937). And so I [made my own...](#behind-the-scenes)

In the wood box was the first of these...

<img src="/images/scavengerhunts/2022-skiving-snackboxes/it-begins-cropped.jpg" alt="Opening the last present" class="mapBorder" />
</a>

You opened it up and underneath the first clue were three chocolate frogs, a box of gummy bears, a box of jellybeans and three macarons in the bottom...

</a>

_Why yes, we did all gain five pounds that Christmas, why do you ask?_

## The first clue

The clue was printed on a card covering the chocolate frog...

<a href="/images/scavengerhunts/2022-skiving-snackboxes/clue-0.png">
<img src="/images/scavengerhunts/2022-skiving-snackboxes/clue-0.png" alt="The first clue" class="mapBorder" />
</a>

To solve this clue, you needed to realize that the fireplace mantle that the Lego Diagon Alley sits on has a _secret compartment_. Inside was the second box...

## The second box

<a href="/images/scavengerhunts/2022-skiving-snackboxes/location-1.jpg">
<img src="/images/scavengerhunts/2022-skiving-snackboxes/location-1.jpg" alt="The basement of the joke shop" class="mapBorder" />
</a>

The clue inside...

<img src="/images/scavengerhunts/2022-skiving-snackboxes/clue-1.png" alt="The second clue" class="mapBorder" />
</a>

What pet would a Gryffindor have that would be louder than a barking dog? A lion of course, in this case, in the form of a tissue box...

## The third box

<a href="/images/scavengerhunts/2022-skiving-snackboxes/location-2.jpg">
<img src="/images/scavengerhunts/2022-skiving-snackboxes/location-2.jpg" alt="A lion tissue box" class="mapBorder" />
</a>

The clue inside...

<img src="/images/scavengerhunts/2022-skiving-snackboxes/clue-2.png" alt="The third clue" class="mapBorder" />
</a>

Admittedly this is a bit of a red herring, as we had a little _Felix Felicis_ replica on a shelf, but after that doesn't pan out, and a fair bit of searching, you might notice this large box on my bar that is in the form of a die...

## The fourth box

<a href="/images/scavengerhunts/2022-skiving-snackboxes/location-3.jpg">
<img src="/images/scavengerhunts/2022-skiving-snackboxes/location-3.jpg" alt="A very large die" class="mapBorder" />
</a>

The clue inside...

<a href="/images/scavengerhunts/2022-skiving-snackboxes/clue-3.png">
<img src="/images/scavengerhunts/2022-skiving-snackboxes/clue-3.png" alt="The fourth clue" class="mapBorder" />
</a>

A number of false starts here as it wasn't near the Lego version of the Knight Bus. Eventually, she found a bottle of Deadhead rum an old friend gave me in the shape of a shrunken head. In the wood box under it was...

## The fifth box

<a href="/images/scavengerhunts/2022-skiving-snackboxes/location-4.jpg">
<img src="/images/scavengerhunts/2022-skiving-snackboxes/location-4.jpg" alt="A bottle of Rum, and a box" class="mapBorder" />
</a>

The clue inside...

<a href="/images/scavengerhunts/2022-skiving-snackboxes/clue-4.png">
<img src="/images/scavengerhunts/2022-skiving-snackboxes/clue-4.png" alt="The fifth clue" class="mapBorder" />
</a>

The hint here was "the old place was smaller than we remembered it!" And so, under the Klutz Hogwarts School building cards, the sixth box was found...

## The sixth box

<a href="/images/scavengerhunts/2022-skiving-snackboxes/location-5.jpg">
<img src="/images/scavengerhunts/2022-skiving-snackboxes/location-5.jpg" alt="Hogwarts, but only a model" class="mapBorder" />
</a>

The clue inside...

<a href="/images/scavengerhunts/2022-skiving-snackboxes/clue-5.png">
<img src="/images/scavengerhunts/2022-skiving-snackboxes/clue-5.png" alt="The sixth clue" class="mapBorder" />
</a>

This should have been an easy one as she was the one who made the candle holder for me, but, eventually, the final box was found...

## The seventh box

<a href="/images/scavengerhunts/2022-skiving-snackboxes/location-6.jpg">
<img src="/images/scavengerhunts/2022-skiving-snackboxes/location-6.jpg" alt="Happiness can be found... candle holder" class="mapBorder" />
</a>

The clue inside...

<a href="/images/scavengerhunts/2022-skiving-snackboxes/clue-6.png">
<img src="/images/scavengerhunts/2022-skiving-snackboxes/clue-6.png" alt="The seventh clue" class="mapBorder" />
</a>

The final challenge was finding the present—along with the final card—not in the Kitchen, but in the Kitchen pantry...

<a href="/images/scavengerhunts/2022-skiving-snackboxes/clue-7.png">
<img src="/images/scavengerhunts/2022-skiving-snackboxes/clue-7.png" alt="Congratulations!" class="mapBorder" />
</a>

The card was on top of her present, a Roomba - to help her "clean up" her new apartment. (She ended up naming the Roomba &ldquo;Dobby&rdquo;.)

_Merry Christmas_

## Behind the Scenes

This scavenger hunt wouldn't have been feasible without my Cricut Air that I got a few years prior. Here is the original prototype I made:

<a href="/images/scavengerhunts/2022-skiving-snackboxes/prototype.jpg">
<img src="/images/scavengerhunts/2022-skiving-snackboxes/prototype.jpg" alt="Prototype of the skiving snackbox" class="mapBorder" />
</a>

You can see at the top, I had an idea that I would leave the top of the box attached to the sides with the theory that when you lifted the top, it would spread out the sides. That did not work so well in practice!

I recreated [MinaLima's Weasley logo](https://minalima.com/product/weasleys-wizard-wheezes-advertisement/) as [SVG](https://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/) to use as a cutout for the sides of the boxes.

</a>

The outside of the box is orange, with the inside shell purple. I used the orange cutout W's to paste inside for maximum Weasley logo coverage.

I sent a picture of the cutout W's as a teaser the week before Christmas...

</a>

For the inner boxes, I used red, green and blue paper...
