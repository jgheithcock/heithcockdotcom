We have both found Tarot cards and card reading fun and so for this year's hunt, I thought "What if Hermione had made notes from Trawlawney's class - on Tarot cards - after all, she was surprisingly accurate there. What would that look like?"

In the box is a letter from Hermione...

<a href="/images/scavengerhunts/2023-trawlawnys-tarot/letter.jpg">
<img src="/images/scavengerhunts/2023-trawlawnys-tarot/letter.jpg" alt="Letter from Hermione" style="max-width:100%;" />
</a>

The letter reads...

<div style="padding-left: 1em;max-width:24em">
<i>
Dearest Morgan,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was Harry who actually suggested a theme for this year’s
scavenger hunt. I had been searching through some of my old
notes from Hogwarts and had left out my notes from when I was
still attending Divination. Harry had seen them and was going
through them saying that I had more notes than he recalled
Professor Trelawney actually discussing - and that I should share
them with you.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While it is true that she was an appalling teacher and a real
old fraud, she did seem at her best when she was discussing the
Tarot. She still had so many of the hackneyed ‘dark-haired young
man, strong and domineering’ bits but the historical records of
Tarot card use and the changing art forms was thought-provoking.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope you find this years hunt of some interest in any case
and Merry Christmas and happy holidays!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Affectionately,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hermione

Also in the box was page one of Hermione's notes...

## Notes on the Major Arcana in Waite-Smith

### 0. The Fool

  <div class="notes">

_"Everyone starts at the beginning...."_

> — Rubeus Hagrid, _Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone_

The fool is our hero at the start of their journey. A white rose in one hand, a bindle stick in the other, no home and few cares. The fool is how we all begin, whether we are Harry Potter, just arriving at Hogwarts, or any other would-be hero in a story.

In early Tarot versions, the fool is a beggar or vagabond, and the white dog is a bear or wolf attacking them. In Waite-Smith, our fool is young and innocent. A white dog is a companion, whether warning them of their danger or enjoying the day is up to interpretation. In western comic tradition, having the character face to the left indicates the character is going "backwards" in the plot, but the Hermetic Tarot references compass directions, and so our fool faces North West - symbolic of the unknown.

  </div>
</div>

<hr />

This was intended to be an easy clue to get things started, there are two references to Harry as our Fool, and Harry's boon companion is Hedwig...

<img src="/images/scavengerhunts/2020-an-owl-post-christmas/hedwig.jpg" alt="Hedwig the Owl" class="mapBorder" />

Inside Hedwig was a packet, with our first real clue, Harry Potter, as the Fool...

There was a slip of paper attached to the bottom with half the text missing. There was also the next page of notes, covering the next two cards in the Major Arcana...

### 1. The Magician

<div class="tarot" aria-label="Notes on the Magician">
  <div class="card">
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magician_(tarot_card)">
      <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/de/RWS_Tarot_01_Magician.jpg/300px-RWS_Tarot_01_Magician.jpg" alt="The Magician - Pamela Colman Smith" />
    </a>
  </div>
  <div class="notes">

_"The greatest wizard in the world is Albus Dumbledore."_

> — Harry Potter, _Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets_

"As above, so below" — this is the gesture Waite-Smith has our magician in. Outdoors and open to all. The roses and lilies at his feet match his outer red robe and inner white garment. The red roses stand for passion and desire, the lilies purity of thought. Together, they symbolize balance—we will also see these on the Two of Wands with a similar message. On his table are all the suits of the deck, symbolizing his mastery over all elements. Finally, we have two symbols of eternity, the [lemniscate or infinity symbol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity_symbol) over his head like a halo, and an [ouroboros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ouroboros) for a belt.

Hajo Banzhaf, in _Tarot and the Journey of the Hero_, considers the Magician and the High Priestess as the Heavenly, or Spiritual, parents and the Empress and the Emperor as the Earthly or Physical parents. But to me a more compelling interpretation is that the magician and the high priestess are are their inner id—the people the fool looks up to and wishes to emulate.

  </div>
</div>

### 2. The High Priestess

<div class="tarot" aria-label="Notes on the High Priestess">
  <div class="card">
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_High_Priestess_(tarot_card)">

    </a>
  </div>
  <div class="notes">

_"As there is little foolish wand-waving here, many of you will hardly believe this is magic."_

> — Severus Snape, _Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, Ch 8_

The High Priestess is the other side of the coin to the Magician. Where the magician acts out in the open for all to see, the High Priestess is the keeper of secret knowledge and her reign is of the mind and spirit. The veil behind her is decorated with pomegranates and palms, symbols of both death and eternal life. The book of law she holds is half hidden behind her cloak, the lunar crest at her feet, further demonstrations that while some knowledge is spoken, other must be inferred.

> [!TIP]
> For your next step on your journey:<br/>can you find a _secret_, magical book—a hard to reach book...?

  </div>
</div>
<hr />

There are a number of books in this house that could be considered secret, magical, and hard to reach. Finally, the next set of notes was found in a box that mimics the book, _Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows_....

<a href="/images/scavengerhunts/2023-trawlawnys-tarot/locations/secret-magical-book.jpg">

Along with the next set of notes were two more Harry Potter themed Tarot cards, Dumbledore as the Magician and Snape as the High Priestess...

And affixed to the top and bottom were two slips of paper, with the bottom and top part of some text.

The next page of the notes were for three cards this time...

### 3. The Empress

  <div class="card">

    </a>
  </div>
  <div class="notes">

_"She had a way of seeing the beauty in others...."_

> — Remus Lupin, _Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban_

Historically, the Empress, aside from being seen as the ultimate mother-figure, is portrayed as the pragmatic problem solver, but she is also someone who acts with compassion. In Waite-Smith's tarot, the shield with an eagle, symbolizing royalty, has become a heart, embossed with the symbol for Venus. They also place her outdoors, in front of a field of ripening wheat, with red pomegranates on her vestments. The Empress is maternal and life-giving, but it would be wise to recall her background of social and political power.

  <div class="notes">

_"Yeh did as much as yer father would’ve done, an’ I can’ give yeh no higher praise than that."_

> — Rubeus Hagrid, _Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, Ch 37_

"The emperor tarot card has become a receptacle for our modern notions about masculinity and patriarchal authority." [^1] At the time of the Tarot's invention, there were two combatting patriarchies: the Emperor was engaged in an ongoing power struggle with the Pope, or the Hierophant.

The red robes symbolize the creative fire. The orb in his left hand, his royal authority. The throne, willpower over the material world. Thus, the Emperor represents the best of father figures, but our fool must decide which attributes are useful and which are merely baggage from the past.

_"I will have order!."_

"Obedience and tradition."[^2] "The Hierophant represents traditional, orthodox teaching considered suitable to the masses."[^3] The Hierophant represents social approval, the need to conform, the importance of ritual and the outer forms of religion.

At the time of the creation of the Tarot, the Holy Roman Emperor and the three popes of the catholic church were at odds, both spiritually and physically. It is worth noting that the Hierophant has two acolytes kneeling before them; characteristically, the Hierophant has no shortage of followers.

_"I can smell freshly mown grass and new parchment and—"_

> — Hermione Granger, _Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince_

As with many cards in the Tarot, there is a simple face-value representation to this card, but also a more nuanced meaning. In a deeper sense, _The Lovers_ is a card about forming relationships, it is also about change and difficult choices as love is a driving force. In many ways, this card is the first call to adventure.

  </div>
</div>

### 7. The Chariot

<div class="tarot" aria-label="Notes on the Chariot">

  <div class="notes">

_"If yeh know where to go...."_

> — Rubeus Hagrid, _Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, Ch 5_

Representing both the ability of movement as well as the desire, one of the frequent call outs of this card is the two sphinxes facing in somewhat opposite directions and in different colors. In the Marseille deck, the horses are also in opposing directions and blue and red. Hagrid's comment to Harry therefore is an important one -- movement needs guidance and control.

  </div>
</div>

### 8. Strength

  </div>
  <div class="notes">

_"The trick with any beast is ter know how to calm 'em."_

> — Rubeus Hagrid, _Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone_

Strength is clearly needed, but it is notable that the art for Waite-Smith is a female figure, her hands lightly on the lion's head. A garland of flowers adorn her hair and she has a chain of roses as well. The lemniscate, the same as that over the magician's head, symbolizes life. The lion may represent a force of nature but also may represent an internal struggle with one's own inner animalistic desires. In either case, the card demonstrates that the path forward is via empathy and understanding, not brute force

  <div class="notes">

_"Let us step out into the night and pursue that flighty temptress, adventure."_

A reminder that, regardless of what decisions we make, or our preparedness, adventure and a change of fortune comes for us all. I also think of Fred's comment "I've always felt our futures lay outside the world of academic achievement." For some, an uncertain life is the only life. In either case, our fool must be prepared for some ups, and some downs.

### 11. Justice

  </div>
  <div class="notes">

_"For the Greater Good."_

> — Albus Dumbledore, _Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Ch 18._

I think the Justice card has many parallels to the Hierophant. Both cards espouse what is clearly a positive value and outcome, but both are also the representation of those values as seen by those currently in charge. It is, in short, the justice of law. While it is a commendable pursuit, its practitioners should aspire to do more than, as Cornelius Fudge said once "Got to be seen to be doing something."

  </div>
  <div class="notes">

_"Undesirable No. 1"_

> — Ministry of Magic, _Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Ch 13._

The Hanged Man is a card that has had many changes from its original meaning, although the artwork is largely unchanged. In the Renaissance Italy, when the original tarot was created, if an individual could not be brought in to stand for their crimes, the governing authorities would commission an _Pittura Infamante_ to be painted in a public location, as a way of hanging the subject in effigy. And so in original Tarot readings, the hanged man represented traitors and traitorous behavior. But _"blood traitor is next to Mudblood in my book"_ -- clearly one person's act of treason is another's act of defiance. Waite-Smith and others that followed them consider the Hanged Man a sign of repudiating their own self-desires.

  </div>
</div>

<hr />

Our Fool has chosen their path and gone a good ways down it. The remaining cards are now more about outcomes than specific personal growth.

Doubtless the toughest clue of the bunch. I guess I do more cooking than others as I thought the kitchen scales were obvious. In any case, in the drawer next to the scales were the next set of notes and the three new Harry Potter versions of the prior three Tarot cards....

_"To the well-organised mind, death is but the next great adventure."_

> — Albus Dumbledore, _Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, Ch 17._

A reminder that all things end. Whether that be one's studies at school, a job, or even life itself. But endings are simultaneous with beginnings. Ahead of Death is a rising sun.

The white rose on the flag is traditionally a symbol of light, innocence and rebirth. (Also a symbol for the Rosy Cross, a symbol of the Rosicrucians and the Philosopher's stone.) In front of Death, a rising sun between two towers sheds light on the city below.

The figure at the bottom right of Death is now the central figure as an angel.

The angel itself shows the divine nature of moderation. Numerous symbols of balance are visible--the triangle inside the square, one foot in the water with one foot on the land.

This card, aside from the face-value, is a reminder of the importance of moderation, of restraint.

The Devil is less about a supernatural evil, but more the opposite figure of the card preceding it, Temperance. Giving in to our own animal nature, letting our desires choose our path. One key piece of symbolism is that the chains holding our two human figures are loose -- they can leave if they choose.

Like death, the tower represents something we inherently fear and loath, yet cannot move forward without: sudden, sometimes catastrophic change. It may be the loss of someone or something one has come to depend on, it may be a crisis of faith our hero experiences internally. But frequently, it is only after a severe shakeup that a revelation and breakthrough can occur.

The moon, while it does illuminate the night, changes our perceptions and creates an otherworldly perspective that can confuse and even trap our hero. It has been associated with fear, illusions, as well as imagination. While "in dreams, we enter a world that is entirely our own" this card is also a reminder to wake up, and live our lives with our eyes open.

This was a long hunt, not least as she took the time to read through all of the notes, but she said it was one of her favorites. I had thought she might get tripped up on this last clue but she went right to a wooden globe I had made the prior Christmas.

## The Final Clue

Now came deciphering the final clue. She had to arrange the cards in order and by so doing, would be able to read the words between the cards:

</center>

So one final hunt, this one over at Sharlee's, her grandmother. And here, I confess I was looking forward to a prolonged search of all the hidden nooks and dark crannies that can be found in a person's place. But no, she found it in the first place she looked, inside the closed TV cabinet, behind the TV...

On the present was the [Knight of Swords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight_of_Swords), but with Ginny as the knight.

</a>

And inside, a pillow that Sharlee had embroidered once before - long before the fire. This was a recreation with some detective work on my part and my wife's assistance - and a lot of work on Sharlee's part - again! (So it was very appropriate for it to be found at Sharlee's!)

## Behind the scenes

As with so many, this hunt went through a fair few changes. I first thought I would have a Celtic Cross, but then realized it would be very challenging to "force" the next card. It was a fortunate moment to remember [Eden Gray's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eden_Gray) "The Fool's Journey" - very much derived from Joseph Campbell's 1949 [The Hero with a Thousand Faces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hero_with_a_Thousand_Faces).

The question remained, how to layout the final clue pointing to Sharlee's side of the house? There are a fair few ways of dividing out the 22 cards, 21 if we exclude the fool. Twenty-one is good as it divides evenly by 7 - one group of three cards for each clue. But that worked poorly for thematic reasons and so I came up with something that visually looked good and still kept a theme.

I also decided, as a stretch goal, to attempt to make custom Tarot cards, with appropriate characters from Harry Potter and, if possible, only use each character once. Each set of notes would cover some group of the Major Arcana, when you deciphered the end clue and found the next set of notes, you would also get the Harry Potter version of those cards (with the half clues at the top and bottom).

For these custom cards, my first thought was to take line drawings of Colman Smith's art and modify them to be Harry Potter characters. This proved far too much beyond my artistic abilities and, in the end, I created these blending some generative AI, found art, and heavy us

Each of the cards was some blend of generative AI, found art, and heavy modification (and in a few instances, creation) in Photoshop.

### From birth to adolescence

#### The Fool

Harry is our titular protagonist and so it was easy for him to play the fool. I was very happy with the way the art came out. This is not Harry at the end of the series, to be clear, but Harry from chapter five of _Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone_, saying to himself "It was a dream..."

</div>
</div>

#### The Magician

Dumbledore was the clear choice for the Magician. Aside from being "the greatest wizard in the world", Dumbledore is the preeminent role model for Harry. There were a number of happy accidents with this version of Dumbledore as the Magician. Outdoors with the same "As above, so below" pose. Flowers at his feet and green leaves above. Additionally, I like that Dumbledore has two wands, the Elder Wand, in use, and his previous wand, never mentioned explicitly in the book, hangs down by his side, unused but present.

</div>
</div>

#### The High Priestess

At first, I thought of using Professor McGonagal as the High Priestess. But McGonagal really isn't the keeper of secret knowledge and isn't really a role model to Harry - we never even see a teacher-student relationship with McGonagal and Harry. But Harry learns quite a good deal from Professor Snape. "Well,’ said Hermione, ‘I thought he sounded a bit like you." [^4] Harry learns Potions from Snape. "Just shove a bezoar down their throats."

<hr class="marauders-low">

#### The Empress

Lily Potter was the clear choice for the Empress, but getting the art even passable was a challenge. The full quote is _"She had a way of seeing the beauty in others, even and, perhaps, most especially, when that person could not see it in themselves."_ [^5] Some others I looked at were _"We never left"_ [^6] and _"What magic is this?"_ [^7] (Professor Quirrell)

#### The Emperor

Similarly, James Potter was the clear choice for the Emperor, the challenge here was finding a good quote. I think part of my challenge is that James Potter isn't a particularly sympathetic character to me. The few times we get to see him as he lived frankly do not cast him in the very best light. Some other alternate quotes were:

> "My father was a great man. Your father was a swine." [^8]<br/>
> "I'm pretty sure my father would have wanted to know why you aren't sticking with your own kid." [^9]<br/>
> "Until the very end." [^9]<br/>
> "Gryffindor, where dwell the brave at heart!" [^9]<br/>
> "Sometimes you remind me a lot of James." [^4]<br/>
> "He was looking at himself but with deliberate mistakes" [^8]<br/>
> "He was good at pretty much everything" [^8]<br/>

[^8]: _Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix_
[^9]: J.K. Rowling. _Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows_

But in the end, I thought Hagrid's quote was best.

### From adolescence to adulthood

Our hero now goes through individuation---developing relationships, their own will, empathy and introspection.

#### The Lovers

There were a number of couples that could have been on this card - Harry & Cho Chang, Ron & Hermione, Ron & Lavender. But as this is Harry's journey, Harry & Ginny are the clear choice. Likewise, there were a lot of relevant quotes---

> "...to have been loved so deeply..." [^7]<br/>
> "It is impossible to manufacture or imitate love" [^4]<br/>
> "Always" [^9]

In any case, who else but Professor Lockhart for playing Cupid?

</div>

#### The Chariot

For Harry, perhaps the more obvious chariot would have been his broom---or even the [Weasley's Ford Anglia](https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Flying_Ford_Anglia). But it was Sirus's motorcycle that took him to the Dursleys' and then, sixteen years later, permanently away from the muggle world.

Once that was settled on, it seemed clear that Hedwig and Sirius in his transfigured form of a black dog would make perfect versions of the white and black sphinxes that pull the chariot in different directions.

#### Strength

It was clear to me from the beginning that Hagrid would play the part of Strength. Hagrid embodies all of the great concepts in Waite and other's interpretation of Strength---tempered by empathy.

</a>
</div>
</div>

#### The Hermit

There are a fair few good choices for playing the Hermit if you only think of them as a loner. But the hermit was originally time---and its affects. In the 17th century the art changed to give the appearance of the subject searching for something "like Diogenes searching for an honest man."[^10] It is in this light that I think [Mad-Eye Moody](https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Alastor_Moody) fits well. An old soldier, having suffered the ravages of battle, still holds his own internal light and continues to be unceasingly vigilant.

#### The Wheel of Fortune

I'll be honest, this one is a bit of a reach. I think it works, but it is not as clear cut. Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes at least fit in that one might be stepping along, high, wide and plentiful, then come across a [canary cream](https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Canary_Cream) and come a purler. The wheel of fortune at work.

The items in the corners, replacing the [four evangelists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Evangelists) are four items from the joke shop:

- [Ton-Tongue Toffee](https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Ton-Tongue_Toffee)
- A [Decoy detonator](https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Decoy_Detonator)
- A [Skiving Snackbox](./2022-skiving-snackboxes)
- [Extendable Ears](https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Extendable_Ears)

#### The Hanged Man

I went back and forth on this one quite a bit. On the one hand, Harry himself, both as the hero as well as what he goes through, is a great candidate for the hanged man and, in the end, I used the "Undesirable No. 1" quote to illustrate the card. But the hanged man is also about betrayal and traitorous behavior. And that really called out [Peter Pettigrew](https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Peter_Pettigrew). Not duplicating characters was also a consideration and so I went with Peter. If you can't tell, this is a heavily modified picture of Peter Pettigrew as a [Lego mini-fig](<https://brickset.com/minifigs/hp196/peter-pettigrew-(wormtail)-black-suit-light-bluish-gray-right-hand>).

### Beyond Adulthood, Outcomes and Enlightenment

At this point in the Fool's journey, the hero has gotten a grip on things sufficently, but now faces more serious outcomes and challenges before hopefully experiencing enlightenment and final conclusions.

#### Death

I first thought about Voldemort---or a masked death eater. But as Dumbledore points out, Voldemort fears death. And so [Thestrals](https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Thestral) came to mind. "The only people who can see Thestrals, are people who have seen death." And this card is very much about accepting death.

#### Temperance

I think I was a bit flumuxed about Temperance. But the more I thought of it, the more Hermione seems to be a perfect avatar for moderation, management and balance. As an alternate quote I thought of _"I am afraid I counted on Miss Granger to slow you up, Harry."_ but decided to go more with the action than the avatar. I also had a number of other art sources that would have fit the visual theme better, but this was the best Hermione I could come up with.

#### The Devil

The Devil, as interpreted by Waite, Gray, and others, is less about evil and more about the opposite of Temperance. And so it occured to me that the over-fondness Horace Slughorn has to material comforts (and crystalised pineapple) would make him well suited for this role. The figures below are Ron and Lavender Brown.

_Alternate Quotes:_

> "Still...the prudent wizard keeps his head down in such times."<br/>
> "...his great velvet-covered belly seemed to fill all the remaining space in the compartment."<br/>
> "He can be charming when he wants to be..."<br/>

#### The Tower

The tower was the easiest choice of all of them. Trawlaney's quote really set all of this up and then the visual image of the Dark Mark over the [Astronomy Tower](https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Astronomy_Tower). It is only at this point that we can see that it is, indeed, all up to Harry.

#### The Star

There was never a question as to who would play the part of the star. It was always going to be Luna Lovegood, with her quirky, yet uncomfortably accurate, exposition of the world. The star Tarot card has always been a bit of a mixed set of imagery. "This frees us to project our favorite myths onto the Star image."[^11]

#### The Moon

Similarly, the moon was always going to be [Remus Lupin](https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Remus_Lupin). As the Moon Tarot card has had two creatures howling at the moon, who would be a better companion than Sirius?

#### The Sun

I had wanted a much closer version to the [Rider-Waite deck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rider%E2%80%93Waite_Tarot), with Luna's father, [Xenophilius Lovegood](https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Xenophilius_Lovegood) as the 'babe' astride the horse. But when I got this sun-centric version, I realized it was a great tie-in to the ultimate present and so let it ride.

#### The World

Only if you let me skate by on the Lovers and insist that it is Professor Lockhart, as Cupid, that is the avatar for the Lovers, do I get to say I didn't repeat anyone. In any case, who else but Ginny can be the avatar for Harry as _the World_. I did have a couple of good quotes, one from Luna: "I think the anser is that a circle has no beginning." and the other, the final lines of the series: "All was well."

#### Backs

I was initially going to have a simple pattern of repeated alchemical symbols for fire (🜂), water (🜄), earth (🜃) and air (🜁) but that looked overly simplistic...

<a href="/images/scavengerhunts/2023-trawlawnys-tarot/cards/back-fire-earth-water-air.png">
  <img src="/images/scavengerhunts/2023-trawlawnys-tarot/cards/back-fire-earth-water-air.png" alt="Fire, Earth, Water & Air back" />
</a>

I was then going to use more interesting symbols, for the moon, star, sun and earth

<a href="/images/scavengerhunts/2023-trawlawnys-tarot/cards/back-sun-moon-earth-star.png">
  <img src="/images/scavengerhunts/2023-trawlawnys-tarot/cards/back-sun-moon-earth-star.png" alt="Sun, moon, earth and star back" />
</a>

But my wife convinced me to go for a more interesting back, one that evoked the [dueling table](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/289637819766509184/) and, lets face it, looked cooler. And so I modified an image from [VectorStock.com image](vectorstock.com/47230429) to change the color scheme and extend it to fit the traditional Tarot card dimension (2.75" x 4.75")....
