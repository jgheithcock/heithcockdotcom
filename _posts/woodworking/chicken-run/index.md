Once you get some chickens, there is a desire to get even more. But that takes
more space. My daughter volunteered to help me build a run - which was good in
any case as we discovered the hard way that we shouldn't let the chickens out,
even if we were watching over them. This project broke my rule of not buying
material but we needed the pressure-treated wood as it was dug into the side
of the hill.

The finished [chicken coop](/woodworking/chicken-coop) was about 4' x 8', which
I had thought was big enough for 2-3 chickens, which was what we first planned
on having. But then we got 4 and wanted more and that was pushing it.

The first task was a *lot* of digging. You can just see the pile to the left.
You can also see the root to the left that had to go.

After digging holes for the posts, installing and pouring concrete around them,
we started getting the initial frame and exterior pressure boards for the
retaining walls, starting from the corner of the existing coop. Where Morgan is
standing will be the full-sized doorway to access the run. We will later cut out
a chicken-sized doorway where the shovel is to allow the chickens to come and go
or to shut them out of the run (or the coop) for any maintenance or behavioral
issues.

Continuing from the doorway, more retaining walls. You can also see the studs
above for the roof, which will be covered by hardware cloth.

Finally connecting back to the coop.

Building the planters to grow some chicken-resistent herbs.[^1] We had also laid
overlaying hardware cloth sheets on the ground and stapled them to the sides and
then covered them with gravel to keep the cloth down. Sadly, 90% of the gravel
then traveled up to displace the earth put on top of the gravel due to [granular
convection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granular_convection).

When finished, we covered the sides and roof with hardware cloth - thicker than
the typical 'chicken wire'.

Finally, inside the finished chicken run, with the ill-fated plantings. The
[Barred Plymouth Rock](

chicken Morgan is holding was named Peppercorn.

[^1]: Spoiler: There are no chicken-resistant plants. I was able to keep some
rosemary going for some time but finally they squashed it.
