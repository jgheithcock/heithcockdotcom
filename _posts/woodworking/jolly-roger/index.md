My daughter and I were big fans of the Pirates of the Carribean and I was always
very enamoured of the animatronic Jolly Roger at the beginning of the ride. This
is really very little woodworking and more of an Arduino project. To start, I had
gotten a not-quite lifesized resin skull and two cheap plastic cutlasses online.
I grabbed two cast-off pieces of my seemingly inexhaustible redwood and laid out
the elements. I had two old curtaian rods that I thought would be good for the
red flag in the background.

Here you see the attached struts to support the cutlasses, with a carved out
hole for the speaker.

With speaker (repurposed from an old radio I think).

The back with the 5-volt battery and wiring.
