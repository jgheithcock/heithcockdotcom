A collection of the smaller, one-day-or-less things I've made.

## Bar Sign

The first thing ever made with the reclaimed redwood was a bar sign painted by my wife. The Two Dragon's and a Phoenix. The two dragons are my wife and daughter, both Dragons - the Phoenix is the house itself, risen from the ashes.

## Jug stand

My daughter threw a pot-luck Halloween party and a guest forgot to bring the
stand for their jug. No problem.

## Desk Shelf

When the girl went off to college, she asked if I could make some shelves that
would sit on her desk.

Bonus: you get to see a card I had made for her, a pop-up bouquet for her
birthday.

## Scrap table

My wife was doing a painting on a very large painting on a large slab of oak
from the ["When a tree falls" exhibition](
https://www.elsworthartworks.com/oil/figures/dryad_exposed/lesher_center_bedford_gallery.html
). She asked if I could make a table for the tree so it would be at the right
height for her to paint (I also fashioned the leg to give it some stability).
This was from some plywood I had lying around and a semi-busted pallet.

Afterwards, my daughter finished the top with spare glass stones we had and it
now lives in my office.

## Desk stand

My wife then said, "Hey, my chair is too tall for my desk, or my desk is too
short for my chair! Anything you can do for that?"

## Art Holder

On a roll, she then said, "I want a clippy thing that will hold my iPad, or any
art I'm using as a source while I paint. Can you do that?"

class="mapBorder" alt="Back of art stand" />
</a>

The back was from a frame for a photograph. I'd been saving that darn wheel for years, just waiting for a chance to use it.

## Door stop

A door-stop I made when working on [Morgan's kitchen shelves](
/woodworking/bookshelf). The knob was again some spare part I couldn't bear to
part with.

## Chickens!

When we got four new [mystic onyx](https://hoovershatchery.com/mystic-onyx)
chickens, I made a larger chick brooder as the tub they were in was too small.
By they time I had finished it, they were already so big they needed to go in
the main coop with the others. I also transformed a wine box into two egg boxes.
I could never get the previous chickens to go for a box - or even in the coop
proper - so I started with the box on the ground (where they were laying) and then
moved the boxes to the coop and they have been laying their consistently ever
since!
